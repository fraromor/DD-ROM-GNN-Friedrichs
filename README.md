## Description
This repository contains the code used to generate the results in the pre-print "**Friedrichsâ€™ systems discretized with the Discontinuous Galerkin method:
domain decomposable model order reduction and Graph Neural Networks
approximating vanishing viscosity solutions**", https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03378.

## Dependencies and installation
The following packages are required `deal.II`, `PETSc`, `petsc4py`, `torch`, `torch_geometric`, `pytorch_lightning` among others.

## Documentation DD-ROMs for Friedrichs' systems
### Procedure for DD-ROMs with repartitioning strategies

Compile the deal.II script. As first step we need to save the matrices needed for the affine decomposition:
```bash
> cd maxwellParallel
> cmake .
> make release
> make 
> mpirun -np 4 ./maxwell
```
we also need the positions of the support points of the dofs for our repartitioning strategies. Inside "parameters.prm" set "task to perform" from "affine" to "save_pos". Then run:
```bash
> mpirun -np 4 ./maxwell
> cd affine_matrices
> python3 postprocess.py 4
> cd ..
> cd ..
```
run offline and online stages in parallel with:
```bash
> mpirun -np 4 python3 run_FOM_ROM.py
```

**Additionally**: to see the partitioning of the computational domain do the following:
```bash
> cd maxwellParallel
```
inside "parameters.prm" set "task to perform" from "affine" to "labels"
```bash
> mpirun -np 4 ./maxwell
```
and open in paraview:
```bash
> paraview partition_0.pvtu
```

**Additionally**: to plot the FOM and ROM solutions do the following:
```bash
> cd maxwellParallel
```
inside "parameters.prm" set "task to perform" from "affine" to "plot"
```bash
> mpirun -np 4 ./maxwell
```
and open the fields in paraview: the FOM fields with
```bash
> paraview snapshots/reconstructed_[0-9].pvtu
```
and the DD-ROM predicted fields
```bash
> paraview snapshots/rreconstructed_[0-9].pvtu
```

### Procedure for vanishing viscosity solutions inference with GNNs
The following procedure is used to infer the vanishing viscosity solutions through our multi-fidelity multi-resolution strategy that makes use of DD-ROMs and GNNs. Run the following to train a GNN with data already obtained from an advection-diffusion-reaction test case: download first the dataset with
```bash
> cd vv
> wget https://zenodo.org/records/13946510/files/vv.tar.gz
> tar -zxfv vv.tar.gz
```
then run the training with:
```bash
> python3 vvgraph_all.py
```
move the file that starts with "tb_logs/vv/version_0/checkpoints/epoch*" in "tb_logs/vv.ckpt" so that it can be loaded by the script "predict.py"
```bash
> python3 predict.py
```
